# Electrical-Devices-Identification-Model

## The problem: 
    
Data mining and analysis of energy data of electrical devices in SHs, e.g., for the dynamic load management, is of fundamental importance for the decision-making process of energy management both from the consumer perspective by saving money and also in terms of energy redistribution and reduction of the carbon dioxide emission, by knowing how the energy demand of a building is composed in the SG. 
The purpose of our system is to apply adequate rules to control the electric appliances in order to save energy and money.

# What is done in this project:

Electrical Devices Identification Model (EDIM) for the identification of electrical devices by analyzing their energy consumption profiles.
